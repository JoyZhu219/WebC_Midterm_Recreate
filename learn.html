                Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with
                fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing (cross-country, Telemark, or ski jumping), which use
                skis with free-heel bindings. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practiced at ski
                resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants,
                and ski patrol.

                The Nordic disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping, which both use bindings that attach
                at the toes of the skier's boots but not at the heels. Cross-country skiing may be practiced on groomed
                trails or in undeveloped backcountry areas. Ski jumping is practiced in certain areas that are reserved
                exclusively for ski jumping.

                Telemark skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned discipline, which is named after the
                Telemark region of Norway. It uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are
                attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier's heel to be raised throughout the turn.
                However, the skis themselves are often the same width as Alpine skis.
